ROBINSON CRUSOE 

CHAPTER I 

Robinson's Family His Elopement from His Parents 

I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a good 
family, though not of that country, my father being a 
foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got 
a good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived 
afterward at York, from whence he had married my mother, 
whose relations were named Robinson, a very good family in 
that country, and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutz- 
naer; but by the usual corruption of words in England we are 
now called, nay, we call ourselves, and write our name, Crusoe, 
and so my companions always called me. 

I had two elder brothers, one of which was lieutenant-colonel 
to an English regiment of foot in Flanders, formerly com- 
manded by the famous Colonel Lockhart, and was killed at 
the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards; what became 
of my second brother I never knew, any more than my father 
and mother did know what was become of me. 

Being the third son of the family, and not bred to any trade, 
my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts. 
My father, who was very old, had given me a competent share 
of learning, as far as house-education and a country free 
school generally goes, and designed me for the law; but I 
would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea; and my in- 
clination to this led me so strongly against the will, nay, the 
commands, of my father, and against all the entreaties and 
persuasions of my mother and other friends, that there seemed 
to be something fatal in that propension of nature tending 
directly to the lie of misery which was to befall me. 

My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and ex- 
cellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design. He 
called me one morning into his chamber, where he was con- 
fined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly with me upon 
this subject. He asked me what reasons more than a mere 
wandering inclination I had for leaving my father's house and 
my native country, where I might be well introduced, and had 
a prospect of raising my fortunes by application and indus- 
try, with a life of ease and pleasure. He told me it was for 
men of desperate fortunes on one hand, or of aspiring, superior 
fortunes on the other, who went abroad upon adventures, to 
rise by enterprise, and make themselves famous in undertak- 
ings of a nature out of the common road; that these things 
were all either too far above me, or too far below me; that 
mine was the middle state or what might be called the upper 
station of low life, which he had found by long experience was 
the best state in the world, the most suited to human happi- 
ness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the labor and 
sufferings, of the mechanic part of mankind, and not em- 
barrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and envy of the 
upper part of mankind. He told me I might judge of the 
happiness of this state by this one thing, viz., that this was 
the state of life which all other people envied; that kings have 
frequently lamented the miserable consequences of being born 
to great things, and wished they had been placed in the middle 
of the two extremes, between the mean and the great ; that the 
wise man gave his testimony to this as the just standard of true 
felicity, when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches. 

He bid me observe it, and I should always find, that the 
calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part 
of mankind; but that the middle station had the fewest dis- 
asters, and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the 
higher or lower part of mankind. Nay, they were not sub- 
jected to so many distempers and uneasiness either of body 
or mind as those were who, by vicious living, luxury, and ex- 
travagances on one hand, or by hard labor, want of necessar- 
ies, and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand, bring dis- 
tempers upon themselves by the natural consequences of their 
way of living; that the middle station of life was calculated 
for all kind of virtues and all kind of enjoyments; that peace 
and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune ; that tem- 
perance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all agreeable di- 
versions, and all desirable pleasures, were the blessings attend- 
ing the middle station of life ; that this way men went silently 
and smoothly through the world, and comfortably out of it, 
not embarrassed with the labors of the hands or of the head, 
not sold to the life of slavery for daily bread, or harassed with 
perplexed circumstances, which rob the soul of peace, and the 
body of rest; not enraged with the passion of envy, or secret 
burning lust of ambition for great things; but in easy cir- 
cumstances sliding gently through the world, and sensibly tast- 
ing the sweets of living, without the bitter, feeling that they are 
happy, and learning by every day's experience to know it more 
sensibly. 

After this, he pressed me earnestly, and in the most affection- 
ate manner, not to play the young man, not to precipitate my- 
self into miseries which Nature and the station of life I was 
born in seemed to have provided against; that I was under no 
necessity of seeking my bread; that he would do well for me, 
and endeavor to enter me fairly into the station of life which 
he had been just recommending to me; and that if I was not 
very easy and happy in the world it must be my mere fate or 
fault that must hinder it, and that he should have nothing to 
answer for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me 
against measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a 
word, that as he would do very kind things for me if I would 
stay and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have 
so much hand in my misfortunes, as to give me any encourage- 
ment to go away. And to close all, he told me I had my elder 
brother for an example, to whom he had used the same earnest 
persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country 
wars, but could not prevail, his young desires prompting him 
to run into the army, where he was killed ; and though he said 
he would not cease to pray for me, yet he would venture to 
say to me, that if I did take this foolish step, God would not 
bless me, and I would have leisure hereafter to reflect upon 
having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist 
in my recovery. 

I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was truly 
prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know it to be 
so himself I say, I observed the tears run down his face very 
plentifully, and especially when he spoke of my brother who 
was killed; and that when he spoke of my having leisure to 
repent, and none to assist me, he was so moved, that he broke 
off the discourse, and told me, his heart was so full he could 
say no more to me. 

I was sincerely affected with this discourse, as, indeed, who 
could be otherwise ; and I resolved not to think of going abroad 
any more, but to settle at home according to my father's desire. 

But alas ! a few days wore it all off ; and, in short, to prevent 
any of my father's farther importunities, in a few weeks after 
I resolved to run quite away from him. However, I did not 
act so hastily neither as my first heat of resolution prompted, 
but I took my mother, at a time when I thought her a little 
pleasanter than ordinary, and told her, that my thoughts were 
so entirely bent upon seeing the world, that I should never 
settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with 
it, and my father had better give me his consent than force me 
to go without it ; that I was now eighteen years old, which was 
too late to go apprentice to a trade, or clerk to an attorney ; that 
I was sure if I did, I should never serve out my time, and I 
should certainly run away from my master before my time 
was out, and go to sea; and if she would speak to my father 
to let me go but one voyage abroad, if I came home again and 
did not like it, I would go no more, and I would promise by 
a double diligence to recover that time I had lost. 

This put my mother into a great passion. She told me, she 
knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon 
any such subject; that he knew too well what was my in- 
terest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt, 
and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing 
after such a discourse as I had had with my father, and such 
kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used 
to me ; and that, in short, if I would ruin myself there was no 
help for me ; but I might depend I should never have their con- 
sent to it; that for her part, she would not have so much hand 
in my destruction, and I should never have it to say that my 
mother was willing when my father was not. 

Though my mother refused to move it to my father, yet, as 
I have heard afterwards, she reported all the discourse to him, 
and that my father, after showing a great concern at it, said to 
her with a sigh, "That boy might be happy if he would stay at 
home, but if he goes abroad he will be the miserablest wretch 
that was ever born: I can give no consent to it." 

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose, 
though in the meantime I continued obstinately deaf to all 
proposals of settling to business, and frequently expostulating 
with my father and mother about their being so positively 
determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted 
me to. But being one day at Hull, where I went casually, 
but I say, being there, and one of my companions being going 
by sea to London, in his father's ship, and prompting me to go 
with them, with the common allurement of sea-faring men, viz., 
that it should cost me nothing for my passage, I consulted 
neither father nor mother any more, nor so much as sent them 
word of it ; but leaving them to hear of it as they might, with- 
out asking God's blessing, or my father's, without any con- 
sideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an ill hour, 
God knows.
